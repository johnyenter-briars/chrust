## About Chrust

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Chrust is a chess engine written in Rust. (Very original I know). This is also an opportunity for me to learn rust above a beginner level and maybe build something kinda cool

Chrust supports the standard Minimax algorighm, A+B pruning, and Piece-Square tables for its decision making.

I'm by no means a Rust expert, so if you see any issues in the source code please don't hesitate to show me where I'm stupid.


### Built With

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
* [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/)
* [ChessBoard.js](https://chessboardjs.com/)

## Getting Started

To try your hand at beating rusty, follow the standard installation steps:

### Prerequisites

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) tooling installed.

### Running Chrust
Clone the source code and navigate to the root directory, and run:
```sh
cargo run -- <args>
```
Then navigate to a browser and then go to either [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) or [127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

## Usage

The binary currently supports several command line arguments.

```sh
./chrust [-z "TERM"|"WEB"] [-t TICK_SPEED] [-h HUMAN_PLAYS] [-p NUM_PLIES]
```

| Flag | Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| z | visulization_mode | Sets the visulization mode of the program - either Unicode on the terminal, or graphical in the browser over localhost |
| t | tick_speed | Sets the interval between moves in milliseconds | 
| h | human_plays | Sets whether or not the human player will play the game. If false, the human player makes random decisions | 
| p | num_plies | Sets the number of turns (plies) the AI will look ahead. Becareful on numbers > 4, as the program will become ungodly slow | 

For a complete description on the arguments, run using the `--help` flag.

## Prerelease

The second Chrust prerelease is completed! Checkout the prerelase here: [0.2.0](https://github.com/johnyenter-briars/chrust/releases/tag/0.2.0)

To run the program, unzip the archive pertaining to your operating system, and run the appropriate binary.

Any feedback is welcome! 

## Building For Release

The newest release of Chrust can be found [here](https://github.com/johnyenter-briars/chrust/releases)

If you wish to build in release mode yourself, build scripts are located in the repo root and titled `build_<platform>.<extension>`.

The build script will place the built binary in the `release` folder, under the sub folder named after the platform (win|mac|linux).
